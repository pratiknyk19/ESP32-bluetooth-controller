Building a Bluetooth Gaming Controller with ESP32 and BleKeyboard Library
Prerequisites
Install the Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE on your computer.

Add ESP32 Board Support: Open Arduino IDE, go to "File" > "Preferences." In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, add the following URL: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json. Then, go to "Tools" > "Board" > "Boards Manager," search for "esp32," and install the ESP32 board support.

Install the BleKeyboard Library: In the Arduino IDE, navigate to "Sketch" > "Include Library" > "Manage Libraries." Search for "BleKeyboard" and install the library.

Hardware Setup
Gather Components: Prepare an ESP32 development board, input components (buttons, switches, etc.), jumper wires, and a power source.

Connect Inputs: Wire your input components to the appropriate GPIO pins on the ESP32. Make sure to include pull-up or pull-down resistors as needed.
